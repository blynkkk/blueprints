# Introduction

In this blueprint there will be a tutorial on connecting the Arduino Leonardo board with Ethernet Shield and controlling the blinking of the LED using the button on the web or mobile dashboard. Also, this code can be used to connect other similar boards, such as Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega.

# 1. Components 

In this project we used:

1. Arduino Leonardo/Uno/Mega board
2. Ethernet Shield
3. USB cable


# 2. Prepare your Hardware before flashing

1. Connect Ethernet Shield to Arduino board
2. Connect Arduino board to computer with a USB cable
3. Insert Ethernet cable to Ethernet Shield
It will look something like this :
*Picture*

# 3. Prepare required software

Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
Install Blynk library for your IDE
Instull Ethernet Library for your IDE
Select the correct board and port in your IDE settings
Create a new sketch (Arduino IDE) or new project (PlatformIO)


# Prepare the Firmware and upload it to your device

We need to include TemplateID, AuthToken (unique identifier of your device) in the sketch. Follow the steps below.

1. Click on the Activate device action in the Template Home tab (this tab should open automatically once you've pressed the Use Blueprint button)
2. Copy the sketch and paste it into the IDE
3. Flash your device
* For Arduino IDE:
 *Insert code into your file*->
 *Choose Port and Board*->
 *Press "Upload" button*
* For PlatformIO:
*Open the "src" folder and open the "Main.cpp" file*->
*Insert the code*->
*Press "PlatformIO: Upload"*

4. The device should open automatically - you are connected now!


# Next steps after the device is activated

* Explore the Blynk Web Console and Blynk IoT app, try controlling your device from both
* Explore Blynk Documentation and learn how to work with Virtual Pins
* Improve the code for your needs
* Add more devices


# Troubleshooting

* Make sure you have the latest Blynk Library installed
* Check that all the dependencies and configurations are correct
* Check your sketch for errors. Click the Verify button to compile your sketch without uploading it
* Check your board and port selections
* Check your connections. Your board needs to be connected with a data USB cable (charge-only cables will not work). Make sure the cable is fully inserted in the port on each end. Try a different USB cable, and avoid hubs and other adapters if possible. Remove connections to the board pins, especially the 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) digital pins.
* Check that your boards and libraries are up to date
